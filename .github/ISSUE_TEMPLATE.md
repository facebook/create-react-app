### Is this a bug report?

(write your answer here)

<!--
  If you answered "Yes":
  
    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about
    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.
    
    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with
    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.

    In either case, please fill as many fields below as you can.

  If you answered "No":

    If this is a question or a discussion, you may delete this template and write in a free form.
    Note that we don't provide help for webpack questions after ejecting.
    You can find webpack docs at https://webpack.js.org/.
-->


### Can you also reproduce the problem with npm 4.x?

<!--
  Many errors, especially related to "missing modules", are due to npm bugs.
  Which version of npm are you running? You can find out by checking:

    npm -v

  If it is 5.x, please be aware that it has more than 50 known bugs, and
  is not guaranteed to work with Create React App.

  If it's not starting with 4, try to install npm 4.x:

    npm install -g npm@4
    cd your_project_directory
    rm -rf node_modules
    npm cache clear
    npm install

  Then try to reproduce the issue again.
  Can you still reproduce it?

  Note: Please try this even if you are using Yarn so that we know whether it's a Yarn-only bug.

### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?

<!--
  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.
  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:

  https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#troubleshooting

  Please scan these few sections for common problems.
  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:
  
  https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.me
  
  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.
  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.
-->

(Write your answer here if relevant.)


### Environment

<!--
  Please fill in all the relevant fields by running these commands in terminal.
-->

1. `node -v`: 
2. `npm -v`:
4. `yarn --version` (if you use Yarn):
3. `npm ls react-scripts` (if you haven’t ejected): 

Then, specify:

1. Operating system:
2. Browser and version (if relevant):


### Steps to Reproduce

<!--
  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn’t know you or your project?
  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.
-->

(Write your steps here:)

1. 
2. 
3. 


### Expected Behavior

<!--
  How did you expect the tool to behave?
  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.
  Just write down what you thought would happen.
-->

(Write what you thought would happen.)


### Actual Behavior

<!--
  Did something go wrong?
  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?
  Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.
-->

(Write what happened. Please add screenshots!)


### Reproducible Demo

<!--
  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.
  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.

  There are two ways to do it:

    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.
      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.

    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.
      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.

  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve
  Once you’re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:
-->

(Paste the link to an example project and exact instructions to reproduce the issue.)

<!--
  What happens if you skip this step?
  
  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial
  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,
  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.
  
  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might
  create a reproducible example for it.

  Thanks for helping us help you!
