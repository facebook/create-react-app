## 0.2.0 (not released yet)

### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)

* You can now enable deployment to GitHub Pages by adding `homepage` field to `package.json` ([@dhruska](https://github.com/dhruska) in [#94](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/94))
* ESLint configuration is now compatible with popular editor plugins ([@keyanzhang](https://github.com/keyanzhang) in [#149](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/149))
* You can now `import` CSS files from npm modules ([@glennreyes](https://github.com/glennreyes) in [#105](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/105), [@breaddevil](https://github.com/breaddevil) in [#178](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/178))
* Development server now runs on `0.0.0.0` and works with VirtualBox ([@JWo1F](https://github.com/JWo1F) in [#128](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/128))
* Generated project now contains `.gitignore` ([@npverni](https://github.com/npverni) in [#79](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/79), [@chibicode](https://github.com/chibicode) in [#112](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/112))
* A stylistic lint rule about method naming has been removed ([@mxstbr](https://github.com/mxstbr) in [#152](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/157))
* A few unobtrusive accessibility lint rules have been added ([@evcohen](https://github.com/evcohen) in [#175](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/175))

### Global CLI (`create-react-app`)

* It enforces that you have Node >= 4 ([@conorhastings](https://github.com/conorhastings) in [#88](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/88))
* It handles `--version` flag correctly ([@mxstbr](https://github.com/mxstbr) in [#152](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/152))

### Migrating from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

Update the global command:

```
npm install -g create-react-app@0.2.0
```

Inside any created project that has not been ejected, run

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.2.0
```

You may need to fix a few lint warnings about missing `<img alt>` tag, but everything else should work out of the box.

If you intend to deploy your site to GitHub Pages, you may now [add `homepage` field to `package.json`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#deploy-to-github-pages).

If you had [issues with integrating editor linter plugins](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/124), add

```js
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": "./node_modules/react-scripts/config/eslint.js"
  }
```

to your project’s `package.json`. If you have already run `eject`, the path would be `./config/eslint.js` instead.
