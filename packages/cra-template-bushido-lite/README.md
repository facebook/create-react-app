# Welcome to Jimmy's Custom Template!

Just like regular create-react-app but so much more. This template includes:

- bushido-strap
- node-sass
- react-router
- react-router-dom
- serve
- styled-components

There is also a `serve` script that let's your run `serve -s build` and a `build-and-serve` script that runs `npm run build && npm run serve`.

This is based off the bushido template I created. Only it's without redux and axios hooked up. So if your working on a simple site that doesn't need to make API calls or use Redux for a global state, this is the template you want to use.

Routes are set in App.js and all components for routes are built in components folder.

## BUSHIDO_STRAP

WTF is bushido-strap? Well, friend, it is a personal style library of mine. It has a bunch of handy styled components I've slowly crafted over time. It's already set up in this project. [Check out the documentation here to see everything this modest style library has to offer!](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bushido-strap)
