      Notice the use of the PUBLIC_URL variable in the tag above.  It is
      replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.  Only
      files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", the above link href path will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      (A natural exception to this is if PUBLIC_URL is defined as an empty
      string.)
      
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
