# Mozilla web console app

This app has been created using [moz-console-react-scripts]() (a fork of the
original
[react-scripts](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts)
that come with `create-react-app`).

You can serve it using:

```sh
$ yarn start
```
