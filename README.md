# `backpack-react-scripts` [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Skyscanner/backpack-react-scripts.svg?branch=fork)](https://travis-ci.org/Skyscanner/backpack-react-scripts)

**⚠️ This is a fork of Facebook's [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).**

Specifically, it is a fork of the [`react-scripts`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts) package. It adds Backpack component support and server-side rendering functionality (amongst other things).

In order to benefit from the ongoing open source development of create-react-app, this fork is kept up-to-date with the upstream repo. To aid this, we have preserved the existing repo structure, including all of the source code for the other packages that live alongside [`react-scripts`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts). **We do not modify any source code outside of [`react-scripts`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts).**
